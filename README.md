**Bank Dataset Classification Project**
**Overview**
This repository contains the code and results for a classification problem using a bank dataset. The aim of this machine learning task is to perform various steps including data cleaning, data visualization, feature engineering, model evaluation, and accuracy assessment.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is from a bank and contains various features related to customers such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, and whether they subscribed to a term deposit or not.

**Project Structure**
data/: This directory contains the dataset used in the project.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
results/: Results of the trained models and evaluation metrics.
src/: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.
**Instructions**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Set up your Python environment and install the required dependencies.
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to perform data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
Refer to the src/ directory for source code related to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
Evaluate the results obtained and iterate on the model as necessary.
